# Security Policy

This repository contains a *test harness* for regulated-agent outputs.

## Reporting
- Do not include secrets, API keys, tokens, or private data in issues.
- If you discover a vulnerability that could expose secrets or enable unsafe behavior in downstream systems,
  describe it minimally and open a private report in the channel you use for disclosures.

## Scope
This harness is not a safety guarantee. It is a governance/testing artifact intended to make failure modes measurable.
